
 - Remove function implementations in Matrix that uses "vec2/3/4"
 - Add reference (&) to T types for vector and matrix
    
 - Matrix manipulations
    * Assign to index span
    * Assign from index span
    * Swap to rows or columns
    * Remove column/row
    * hCat, vCat to the matrix itself, with matrix and vector
    * Insert row
    * Add vector to rows/cols
    * Concatenate several matrices horizontally and vertically
 - Use index span when needed, and not two separate arguments
 - Add temp vectors (pre allocated) to matrix class for when swapping rows

 - Remove existing implementation of "^" and "|" for vector (and matrix)
 - Operations that indexes out vectors should return matrices instead of vectors
 - "switchRows(size_t r0, size_t r1), void switchColumns(size_t c0, size_t c1)" should have const arguments
 - "getColumnVector, getRowVector" should return matrices
 - Quaternion needs to be normalized


 - Remove all "utilities"/"utils" suffixes from utilities files
